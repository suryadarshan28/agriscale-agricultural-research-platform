# 🌱 AgriScale – Agricultural Research Platform

AgriScale is an AI-powered Agricultural Research Platform built as part of the **GenAI 4 GenZ Challenge**.  
It acts as an intelligent research assistant for agronomists, researchers, and farmers by combining crop intelligence, soil analysis, climate adaptation, yield prediction, pest management, and GenAI-powered research compression.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern agriculture requires fast, data-driven decisions. However, farmers and agronomists often rely on lengthy research documents, manual analysis, and experience-based decisions.

AgriScale solves this problem by using **AI, Machine Learning, and GenAI** to:
- Reduce agricultural research time
- Improve crop yield decisions
- Promote sustainable farming practices
